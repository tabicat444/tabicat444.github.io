        I am a big believer in passion projects and trying new things; this website is an ongoing example of both as I experiment with 
        HTML and CSS. Subsequently, this website will always be under construction but you can check out my progress <a href="https://github.com/tabicat444/tabicat444.github.io">here</a>

          <h1>About Me</h1>
          <p class="w3-text-grey">I am fascinated by the overlap of social services, data science, and law. I am an aspiring immigration lawyer and intend to
          research the positive impacts of immigration and refugee resettlement on local communities -- hopefully within California. I recently graduated as a 
            first-generation college student from Princeton University; I've been spending time since reconnecting with my home community. I worked at my former
          high school, Orange Glen, supporting graduating seniors applying to college during COVID-19 and virtual learning. Currently, I'm serving as an AmeriCorps
          VIP (Volunteer Infrastructure Project) Fellow at Jewish Family Service's Refugee Resettlement Agency. </p>
          <h5 class="w3-padding-32">Current Goals and Projects</h5>

          <p class="w3-text-grey">Creative writing, building R package, improving my Spanish</p>

        <div class="w3-third w3-center">

        </div>
      </div>
    </div>

    <!-- Second Grid -->
    <div class="w3-row-padding w3-light-grey w3-padding-64 w3-container">
      <div class="w3-content">
        <div class="w3-third w3-center">
          <i class="fa fa-coffee w3-padding-64 w3-text-red w3-margin-right"></i>
        </div>

        <div class="w3-twothird">
          <h5 class="w3-padding-32">Social Services</h5>

          <p class="w3-text-grey">I am an active Crisis Counselor at Crisis Text Line as well as a certified Domestic Violence Counselor in the State of California. 
          Serving my AmeriCorps term in a refugee resettlement agency has been inspiring; clients, staff, and volunteers have reaffirmed my believe that social 
          services are critical to the longterm success of local communities.</p>
                    <h5 class="w3-padding-32">Data Science</h5>

          <p class="w3-text-grey">I had never coded before college and was actually worried that I was going to break my first laptop by coding in R. My interest in quantitative 
            analysis really began in 2016 as a college freshman: I watched professors grapple with the shock of the 2016 election that the quantitative social science 
            community failed to predict. As a very new first-generation college student, seeing professors make such a glaring mistake really stayed with me. I found it 
            captivating that there was so much room for growth. Over 5 years later, I have graduated with a minor in Statistics and Machine Learning, co-authored a publication 
            on data science teaching pedagogy, freelance as an R tutor and consultant, and am pursuing IBM's Data Science Professional Certificate. </p>
          
                    <h5 class="w3-padding-32">Law</h5>
          <p class="w3-text-grey">I believe that law's involvement in most people's lives is largely indirect. Most people are not cognizant of regulations dictating pieces 
            of their lives. The people who are often the most aware are those whose legal statuses or rights are regularly debated, like refugees, asylees, and immigrants. 
          Growing up in a border community shaped my beliefs and serving with Refugee Resettlement have strengthened them. At Princeton, my research focused on misconduct within
          US Border Protection and how the Trump Administration's Zero-Tolerance Policy negatively impacted the lives of children. </p>
